<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>In a world where new JavaScript frameworks come and go almost daily, why
would you dive into an aging, bare-bones language like C? Well, for one, if you hope to
keep up with all those framework fads (ouch, opinion alert), you might want a background
in just such aging, bare-bones technologies that provide a foundation for so many
“modern” languages. Did you look up popular programming languages on a site like
<a href="https://oreil.ly/ZTdwN">TIOBE</a> and find C consistently at the top?
Maybe you’re interested in the amazingly
advanced video cards and want to see how the software that drives them works.
Or perhaps you’re exploring newer—and much smaller—gadgets
like Arduinos and heard that C is the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>No matter the reason, it’s great to have you here. All of those reasons are valid ones,
by the way. C is a foundational language and understanding its syntax and quirks will
give you a very long-lived computer language literacy that will help you pick up new
languages and styles more easily. C (and its cousin C++) are still widely used when
writing low-level code for device drivers or operating systems. And the Internet of
Things is breathing new life into microcontrollers with limited resources. C is a great
fit for wringing the most of those tiny environments.</p>

<p>While I’ll be focusing on that last idea of writing clean, tight code for tiny,
limited machines, I’ll still start with the basics of computer programming and
cover a variety of rules and patterns that apply to C anywhere you might find it.</p>

<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>

<p>This book aims to cover all the basics of good C programming for any of the
situations mentioned above. We’ll look at control structures, operators,
functions, and other elements of C’s syntax along with examples of alternate
patterns that can shave a few bytes off the size of your compiled program.
We’ll also be looking at the Arduino environment as a great application for
lean C code. To best enjoy the Arduino section, you should have some basic experience
with building simple circuits and using components like LEDs and resistors.</p>

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>

<p>Many of the code examples in this book are quite succinct, and you’ll often benefit
from typing them in by hand. But that isn’t always fun and sometimes you want to start
with a known, working copy and modify stuff. You can grab the source for all of the examples
from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/l0y/smallerc"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/l0y/smallerc</em></a>. <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#smallerc-APP-A">Appendix A</a> has detailed instructions
on downloading the code and setting up the files for use with your development environment.</p>

<p>If you have a technical question or a problem using the code examples, please send an email to <a class="email" href="mailto:bookquestions@oreilly.com"><em>bookquestions@oreilly.com</em></a>.</p>

<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, you may use the example code offered with this book in your programs and documentation.

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>I would like to thank Amelia Blevins for shepherding another book for me through the publication
process. Her project management skills are surpassed only by her ability to improve my writing
through her artful suggestions. Thanks also go to Amanda Quinn and Suzanne McQuade for helping me
get the project off the ground in the first place, and Danny Elfanbaum for his superb tech support.
The entire crew at O’Reilly are peerless.</p>

<p>Our technical reviewers brought a wide range of expertise to the table, and I could not have asked for better feedback.
Tony Crawford tightened up my C code discussions, and I heartily recommend you read his book:
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-in-a/0596006977/" class="orm:hideurl"><em>C in a Nutshell</em></a>. Alex Faber ran every
example in the book on multiple platforms and made sure I kept new programmers in mind. Eric Van Hoose
made my writing clearer and helped focus the flow of the book overall. Chaim Krause filled in at the
last minute and highlighted a few gaps that have been duly filled in turn.</p>

<p>Personal thanks to my husband Ron for wordsmithing advice and general moral support. Reg Dyck also
provided some welcome encouragement. If you ever want to really learn a topic, explain it to friends
and family like Reg and Ron. Neither gent has much interest in programming or electronics, but their
friendly questions helped me suss out the core of what I wanted to say on many difficult topics.</p>
