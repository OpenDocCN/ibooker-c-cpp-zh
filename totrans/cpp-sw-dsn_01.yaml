    I will set the stage for this book on software design. I will explain software
    design in general, help you understand why it is vitally important for the success
    of a project, and why it is the one thing you should get right. But you will also
    see that software design is complicated. Very complicated. In fact, it is the
    most complicated part of software development. Therefore, I will also explain
    several software design principles that will help you to stay on the right path.

- en: 'In [“Guideline 1: Understand the Importance of Software Design”](#understand_the_importance_of_software_design),
    I will focus on the big picture and explain that software is expected to change.
    Consequently, software should be able to cope with change. However, that is much
    easier said than done, since in reality, coupling and dependencies make our life
    as a developer so much harder. That problem is addressed by software design. I
    will introduce software design as the art of managing dependencies and abstractions—an
    essential part of software engineering.'

    a change in some entity `A`. Because of immediate feedback from your tests (you
    are lucky to have tests!), you are quickly reminded that you also have to address
    the issue in entity `B`. That is surprising! You did not expect that `B` was involved

    the nightly build reveals that this causes `C` and `D` to stop working. Before

    Different pieces of code need to work together, and this interaction will always
    create some form of coupling. However, while there are necessary, unavoidable
    dependencies, there are also artificial dependencies that we accidentally introduce
    because we lack an understanding of the underlying problem, don’t have a clear
    idea of the bigger picture, or just don’t pay enough attention. Needless to say,
    these artificial dependencies hurt. They make it harder to understand our software,
    change software, add new features, and write tests. Therefore, one of the primary

    More loosely speaking, C++ idioms are the best practices of the C++ community
    for either design or implementation. In C++, most idioms fall into the category
    of implementation details. For instance, there is the [*copy-and-swap idiom*](https://oreil.ly/hioCd)
    that you may know from the implementation of a copy assignment operator, and the
    [*RAII idiom*](https://oreil.ly/55blq) (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization—you
    should definitely be familiar with this; if not, please see your second-favorite
    C++ book^([15](ch01.xhtml#idm45043125635792))). None of these idioms introduce
    an abstraction, and none of them help to decouple. Still, they are indispensable
    to implement good C++ code.

- en: If software architecture and software design are of such importance, then why
    are we in the C++ community focusing so strongly on features? Why do we create
    the illusion that C++ standards, language mechanics, and features are decisive
    for a project? I think there are three strong reasons for that. First, because
    there are so many features, with sometimes complex details, we need to spend a
    lot of time talking about how to use all of them properly. We need to create a
    common understanding on which use is good and which use is bad. We as a community
    need to develop a sense of idiomatic C++.
  id: totrans-47

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second reason is that we might put the wrong expectations on features. As
    an example, let’s consider C++20 modules. Without going into details, this feature
    may indeed be considered the biggest technical revolution since the beginning
    of C++. Modules may at last put the questionable and cumbersome practice of including
    header files into source files to an end.

    people even expect modules to save their project by fixing their structural issues.
    Unfortunately, modules will have a hard time satisfying these expectations: modules
    don’t improve the structure or design of your code but can merely represent the
    current structure and design. Modules don’t repair your design issues, but they
    may be able to make the flaws visible. Thus, modules simply cannot save your project.
    So indeed, we may be putting too many or the wrong expectations on features.'

    the `User` class depends directly on the `Document` class, which is a necessary

    functionality that we consider to be stable appears on the top, on a high level.
    Functionality that changes more often and is therefore considered to be volatile

    architectures, we often try to show how things build on one another, so the most
    stable parts appear at the bottom of an architecture. That, of course, causes
    some confusion. Independent of how things are drawn, just remember these terms:

    that do not belong together, the things that can change for different reasons.
    Admittedly, at first sight, it may appear as if `Widget` and `updateCollection()`

    lives so much harder and hide the function to test in the `private` section of
    the `Widget` class? Since testing plays a vital role in the presence of change,
    testing represents just another way to help decide which things belong together.
    If the `updateCollection()` function is important enough that we want to test

    I agree, it is very important, fundamentally so! However, encapsulation is just

    C++*, extracting functions from a class is a step toward increasing encapsulation.
    According to Meyers, you should generally prefer nonmember non-`friend` functions
    to member functions.⁠^([36](ch01.xhtml#idm45043121978352)) This is because every
    member function has full access to every member of a class, even the `private`
    members. However, in the extracted form, the `updateCollection()` function is
    restricted to just the `public` interface of the `Widget` class and is not able
    to access the `private` members. Therefore, these `private` members become a little
    more encapsulated. Note that the same argument holds true for extracting the `BlobCollection`
    class: the `BlobCollection` class is not able to touch the nonpublic members of
    the `Widget` class, and therefore `Widget` also becomes a little more encapsulated.'

    You don’t even need a `Widget` for that but instead can either pass `std::vector<Blob>`
    as the first argument (not the implicit first argument of any member function,
    the `this` pointer) or call the `public` member function. Third, you don’t have
    to change any other aspect in the `Widget` class: you simply pass the `blobs_`
    member to the `updateCollection()` function whenever you need to update the collection.
    No need to add any other `public` getter. And, probably most importantly, you
    can now change the function in isolation, without having to deal with `Widget`.
    This indicates that you have reduced dependencies. While in the initial setup
    the `updateCollection()` function was tightly coupled to the `Widget` class (yes,

    of concerns already leads to the desired extensibility. It’s something we will

    we will often have to make explicit decisions about what we want to extend and
    how we want to extend it. That decision can significantly influence how we apply
    the SRP and the way we design our software. Therefore, the OCP seems to be more
    about the awareness of extensions and conscious decisions about extensions than
    the SRP. As such, it is perhaps a little more than just an afterthought of the

    our software in a specific way is an excellent indication for the need to separate

    extensibility is important, this doesn’t mean that you should automatically, without
    reflection, reach for either base classes or templates for every possible implementation
    detail just to guarantee extensibility in the future. Just as you shouldn’t prematurely
    separate concerns, you should also not prematurely design for extension. Of course,
    if you have a good idea about how your code will evolve, then by all means, go
    ahead and design it accordingly. However, remember the YAGNI principle: if you
    do not know how the code will evolve, then it may be wise to wait, instead of
    anticipating an extension that will never happen. Perhaps the next extension will
    give you an idea about future extensions, which puts you in a position to refactor
    the code such that subsequent extensions are easy. Otherwise you might run into
    the problem that favoring one kind of extension makes other kinds of extensions
    much more difficult (see, for instance, [“Guideline 15: Design for the Addition
