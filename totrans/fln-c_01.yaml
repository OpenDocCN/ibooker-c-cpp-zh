- en: Patterns make your life easier. They take the burden of having to cope with
    each and every design decision from you. Patterns explain to you well-proven solutions,
    and in this first part of the book, youâ€™ll find such well-proven solutions and
    the consequences that arise when applying these solutions. Each of the following
    chapters focuses on a particular topic for C programming, presents patterns on
    that topic, and shows their application to a running example.
