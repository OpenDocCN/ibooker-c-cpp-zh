- en: Telling stories is an inherent and natural way to convey information. In the
    world of patterns, it is sometimes difficult to see how the described patterns
    can be applied in a real-world context. To show an example of such pattern application,
    this second part of the book tells you stories of applying the C programming patterns
    from the first part of the book to implement larger programs. You’ll learn how
    to build such programs bit by bit, and you’ll see how the patterns make your life
    easier by providing you with guidance on good design decisions.
