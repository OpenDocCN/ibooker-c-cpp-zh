<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>In your hands you’re holding the C++ book that I wish I would
have had many years ago. Not as one of my first books, no, but as an advanced book, after I
had already digested the language mechanics and was able to think beyond the C++
syntax. Yes, this book would have definitely helped me better understand the fundamental
aspects of maintainable software, and I’m confident that it will help you too.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Why I Wrote This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="why_I_wrote_this_book">
<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>
<p>By the time I was really digging into the language (that was a few years after the first
C++ standard had been released), I had read pretty much every C++ book
there was. But despite the fact that many of these books were great and definitely paved the
way for my current career as a C++ trainer and consultant, they were too
focused on the little details and the implementation specifics, and too far away from the bigger
picture of maintainable software.</p>
<p>At the time, very few books truly focused on the bigger picture, dealing with the development of large software systems. Among these were John Lakos’s <em>Large Scale 
<span class="keep-together">C++</span> Software Design</em>,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="preface01.xhtml#idm45043124158624" id="idm45043124158624-marker">1</a></sup> a great but literally
heavy introduction to dependency management, and the so-called Gang of Four book, which is
<em>the</em> classic book on software design patterns.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="preface01.xhtml#idm45043124283376" id="idm45043124283376-marker">2</a></sup> Unfortunately, over the years, this
situation hasn’t really changed: most books, talks, blogs, etc., primarily focus on
language mechanics and features—the small details and specifics. Very few, and in my opinion
way too few, new releases focus on maintainable software, changeability, extensibility,
and testability. And if they try to, they unfortunately quickly fall back into the
common habit of explaining language mechanics and demonstrating features.</p>
<p>This is why I’ve written this book. A book that does not, in contrast to most others,
spend time on the mechanics or the many features of the language, but primarily focuses on
changeability, extensibility, and testability of software in general. A book that does not
pretend that the use of new C++ standards or features will make the difference
between good or bad software, but instead clearly shows that it is the management of
dependencies that is decisive, that the dependencies in our code decide between it being
good or bad. As such, it is a rare kind of book in the world of C++ indeed, as
it focuses on the bigger picture: software design.</p>

<h1>What This Book Is About</h1>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Software Design" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45043125033840">
<h2>Software Design</h2>
<p>From my point of view, good software design is the essence of every successful software
project. Yet still, despite its fundamental role, there is so little literature on the topic,
and very little advice on what to do and how to do things right. Why? Well, because it’s
difficult. Very difficult. Probably the most difficult facet of writing software that we
have to face. And that’s because there is no single “right” solution, no “golden” advice
to pass on through the generations of software developers. It always depends.</p>
<p>Despite this limitation, I will give advice on how to design good, high-quality
software. I will provide design principles, design guidelines, and design patterns that
will help you to better understand how to manage dependencies and turn your software
into something you can work with for decades. As stated before, there is no “golden” advice,
and this book doesn’t hold any ultimate or perfect solution. Instead, I try to
show the most fundamental aspects of good software, the most important details, the diversity
and the pros and the cons of different designs. I will also formulate intrinsic design goals
and demonstrate how to achieve these goals with Modern C++.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Modern C++" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45043131181312">
<h2>Modern C++</h2>
<p>For more than a decade, we’ve been celebrating the advent of
Modern C++, applauding the many new features and extensions of the language, and
by doing so, creating the impression that Modern C++ will help us solve all
software-related problems. Not so in this book. This book does not pretend that
throwing a few smart pointers at the code will make the code “Modern” or automatically
yield good design. Also, this book won’t show Modern C++ as an assortment
of new features. Instead, it will show how the philosophy of the language has evolved and
the way we implement C++ solutions today.</p>
<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">But of course, we will also see code. Lots of it. And of course this book will make use of the
features of newer C++ standards (including C++20).
However, it will also make an effort to emphasize that the design is independent of
the implementation details and the used features. New features don’t change the rules about
what is good design or bad design; they merely change the way we implement good design. They
make it easier to implement good design. So this book shows and discusses implementation
details, but (hopefully) doesn’t get lost in them and always remains focused on the big
picture: software design and design patterns.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Design Patterns" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45043123821664">
<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
<p>As<a data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="evolution of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45043123482576"/> soon as you start mentioning design patterns, you inadvertently conjure
up the expectation of object-oriented programming and inheritance hierarchies. Yes, this
book will show the object-oriented origin of many design patterns. However, it will put a
strong emphasis on the fact that there isn’t just one way to make good use of a design
pattern. I will demonstrate how the implementation of design patterns has evolved
and diversified, making use of many different paradigms, including object-oriented programming,
generic programming, and functional programming. This book acknowledges the reality that
there is no one true paradigm and does not pretend that there is only one single approach,
one ever-working solution for all problems. Instead it tries to show Modern C++
for what it truly is: the opportunity to combine all paradigms, weave them into a strong
and durable net, and create software design that will last through the decades.</p>
<p>I hope this book proves to be the missing piece in C++ literature. I hope it
helps you as much as it would have helped me. I hope that it holds some answers you
have been looking for and provides you with a couple of key insights that you were missing.
And I also hope that this book keeps you somewhat entertained and motivated to read everything.
Most importantly, however, I hope that this book will show you the importance of software
design and the role that design patterns play. Because, as you will see, design patterns
are everywhere!</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who This Book Is For" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="who_this_book_is_for">
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>
<p>This book is of value to every C++ developer. In particular, it is for every
C++ developer interested in understanding the usual problems of maintainable
software and learning about common solutions to these problems (and I assume that is indeed
<em>every</em> C++ developer). However, this book is not a C++ beginner’s book.
In fact, most of the guidelines in this book require some experience with software development
in general and C++ in particular. For instance, I assume that you have a firm grasp
of the language mechanics of inheritance hierarchies and some experience with templates. Then
I can reach for the corresponding features whenever necessary and appropriate. Once in a while,
I will even reach for some C++20 features (in particular C++20 concepts).
However, as the focus is on software design, I will rarely dwell on explaining a particular
feature, so if a feature is unknown to you, please consult your favorite C++
language reference. Only occasionally will I add some reminders, mostly about common
C++ idioms (such as the <a href="https://oreil.ly/fzS3f">Rule of 5</a>).</p>

<h1>How This Book Is Structured</h1>
<p>This book is organized into chapters, each containing several guidelines.
Each guideline focuses on one key aspect of maintainable software or one particular
design pattern. Hence, the guidelines represent the major takeaways, the aspects that I hope bring
the most value to you. They’re written such that you can read all of them from front to back, but
since they’re only loosely coupled, they enable you to also start with the guideline that attracts your attention. Still, they’re not independent. Therefore, each guideline contains the
necessary cross-references to other guidelines to show you that everything is connected.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>A book such as this is never the achievement of a single individual. On the contrary, I have
to explicitly thank many people who helped me in different ways to make this book a reality.
First and foremost, I want to express my deep gratitude to my wife, Steffi, who read through
the entire book without even knowing C++. And who took care of our two kids to
give me the necessary calm to bring all of this information to paper (I am still not sure
which of these two was the bigger sacrifice).</p>
<p>A special thank-you goes to my reviewers, Daniela Engert, Patrice Roy, Stefan Weller, Mark
Summerfield, and Jacob Bandes-Storch, for investing their valuable time to make this a better
book by constantly challenging my explanations and examples.</p>
<p>A big thank-you also goes to Arthur O’Dwyer, Eduardo Madrid, and Julian Schmidt for their
input and feedback about the Type Erasure design pattern, and to Johannes Gutekunst for
the discussions on software architecture and documentation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I want to say thank you to my two cold readers, Matthias Dörfel and Vittorio
Romeo, who helped catch many last-second mistakes (and indeed they did).</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, a big thank-you goes to my editor, Shira Evans, who has spent
many hours giving invaluable advice about making the book more consistent and more fun to
read.</p>
