<h1><span class="label">Part II. </span>Pattern Stories</h1>
<p>Telling stories is an inherent and natural way to convey information. In the world of patterns, it is sometimes difficult to see how the described patterns can be applied in a real-world context. To show an example of such pattern application, this second part of the book tells you stories of applying the C programming patterns from the first part of the book to implement larger programs. You’ll learn how to build such programs bit by bit, and you’ll see how the patterns make your life easier by providing you with guidance on good design decisions.</p>
