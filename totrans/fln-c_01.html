<h1><span class="label">Part I. </span>C Patterns</h1>
<p>Patterns make your life easier. They take the burden of having to cope with each and every design decision from you. Patterns explain to you well-proven solutions, and in this first part of the book, youâ€™ll find such well-proven solutions and the consequences that arise when applying these solutions. Each of the following chapters focuses on a particular topic for C programming, presents patterns on that topic, and shows their application to a running example.</p>
